In this paper we present a generalized approach to extend the use of word2vec for non traditional NLP (Natural Language Processing). In order to exemplify the idea we use tvtropes dataset (trope names and film names only) to create a text corupus in order to give contextual information to any pice of data.

\section{Introduction}

One of the most important elements in NPL (Natural Language Processing) is the context where words appear inside a text. One of the most popular algorithms to associte numerical vectors to words is word2vec \cite{mikolov2013}. This algorithm use words that are before and after a target word in order to contextualize words. But, what happend if we don't have a text to start analyzing words? What happend if we only have relatinships between terms like
